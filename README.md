# Mouse-Restrainer-for-Tail-IV-Injections
Mice can be fitted through the restrainer using the tail to guide the mouse into the opposite side of restrainer. That oppsoite wall will allow just the tail to stick through and should provide more comfort to perform tail IV injections. The user will be given the option to use the compression handle to keep the mouse more stationary during procedure. 
In this design, a platform to place the restrainer is not given. We used a 8x8inx1in plank of wood and drilled holes matching with the holes of the restrainer legs into the wood. Screws are not provided. 
Similar platforms can be used and is up to the discretion of the user.
